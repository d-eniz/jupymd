There are four key behaviours related to the notebook/note conversion in JupyMD, which are done using jupytext for conversions and pairing:

- **Notebook → Note**: Converts `.ipynb` to `.md` and pairs them.
- **Note → Notebook**: Converts `.md` to `.ipynb` and pairs them.
- **Sync**: Updates paired files <a href="/features/syncing">automatically</a>  (bidirectional or unidirectional).
- **Open in Editor**: Launch paired notebook in an external editor.
